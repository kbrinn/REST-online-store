# Model Package

The model serves as a container holding the application's data. 
It is the layer that interacts with the database, and is placed parallel to the service layer.

The model contains information and functionality that is mapped conceptually to a clear defined real-world entity.

The model sits parallel to the service layer because the service layer contains atomic units of work that
are performed on the model. 

The model represents the state of the application/business domain.
