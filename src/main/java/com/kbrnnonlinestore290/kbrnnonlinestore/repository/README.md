# Repository Package

The repository package is a class that provides the mechanism for storage, retrieval, 
search, update and delete operation on database objects.
@Component annotation is similar to DOA pattern which handles CRUD operations on database tables.

The repository acts as a broker between the model and the database. It is the layer that interacts with the database.
